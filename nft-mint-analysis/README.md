# ⛽️ NFT Gas Analysis

We'd like to understand Polygon PoS "capacity".

What does capacity mean? TODO

One way to do this would be to take a real-use case, e.g. a gaming company that does `x` NFT mints a day with a budget of $`y`.
We could try to understand how much it would cost on different blockchain networks (Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, zksync, etc.) and if it would be sustainable.
